This is a project from The Odin Project which allows students to practice with Node as well as utilizing databases for web-based apps.

For this project you are going to create an Inventory management app for an imaginary store. It’s up to you what kind of business this is – you could be selling groceries, car parts, baby-toys, musical-instruments, ponies or anything!

Your Inventory app should have categories and items, so when the user goes to the home-page they can choose a category to view, and then get a list of every item in that category. You should include all of the CRUD methods for both items and categories, so anybody that’s visiting the site can Create, Read, Update or Delete any Item or Category.
